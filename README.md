# Spinny Clicky Boi 9000
This is a spinny clicky boi that has been created solely for the purpose of Lance John Robinson's 23rd birthday (And for Rory's personal use because he thought it was so cool that he made one for himself too).

## Instalation Instructions
### AHK Script
First you will need to install Autohotkey on your Windows computer from https://autohotkey.com/download/.

Then you will need to insert the Lance.ahk file into the following folder on your Windows computer:
```
C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
You must then right click on the Lance.ahk file and click run.

**CONGRATULATIONS!** You have now installed the **_Spinny Clicky Boi 9000_**.

## Functionality
### General Media Mode
In the general media mode, the dial becomes a volume controller and can be used as follows:
```
Rightsies - Volume Up
```
```
Leftsies - Volume Down
```
```
Clicksies - Mute
```
### Chrome Mode
In the chrome mode, the dial becomes a tab controller, allowing for tab scrolling and closing.

**NOTE:** If the user is in youtube for more than 1 second, the dial switches to media mode, but with clicksies pausing the youtube video instead of muting the volume. Change to a different tab to re-enable chrome mode.
```
Rightsies - Scroll right in tabs
```
```
Leftsies - Scroll left in tabs
```
```
Clicksies - Close tab
```

```
Rightsies - Scroll down
```
```
Leftsies - Scroll up

Clicksies - No functionality (Speak to your benevolent coders if you have an idea for fuynctionality here)
